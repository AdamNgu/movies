# Movie CRUD

A simple front-end React Redux project that lets a user create a list of movies
and store images associated with each movie, saving the results to
local storage for persistence.

Initial package.json based on https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter
for headache-free development. Redux was used to consolidate application state,
storing images in base64 and saving the results to localstorage using a redux library.
